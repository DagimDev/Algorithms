Algorithmic thinking
• Algorithm in programming:

a JavaScript instruction/function involves chopping down an instruction to very small
components and describing it.
• We call the step-by-step instructions that tell a computer to solve a problem algorithm.
This where algorithms come. There are many common examples of algorithms, from
sorting sets of numbers to finding routes through maps to displaying information on a
screen. A recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it says what must be done, step
by step. It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).
