Steps to follow when solving algorithmic problem
• 1. Understand the problem statement
    ▪ You can’t solve a problem you don’t understand.
    ▪ Read the problem as many times as possible until you understand every word used
within the problem
    ▪ Use your own words to describe the problem.
    ▪ Try explaining the problem to a friend and see if their understanding of your
explanation matches the problem

2. Hand-write the solution or solve it on paper first
    ▪ Take out a piece of paper and work through the problem manually. If needed, make
a drawing depicting the problem
    ▪ Use all the important information available in the problem
    ▪ Use example cases/sample data to make sure that you can solve the problem on
paper
    ▪ NOTE: The most difficult part for newcomers is not actually solving the problem.
The difficulty is in understanding and identifying the smallest steps the brain takes
to solve the problem. Our brain is sometimes too fast for us to comprehend
