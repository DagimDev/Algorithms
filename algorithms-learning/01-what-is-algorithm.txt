Title: What Is an Algorithm?
Definition (Simple):
An algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving a problem or performing a task.

Definition (Technical):
In computer science, an algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions written to perform a task 
or solve a problem using a computer.

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy: Making a Cup of Tea
Boil water.

Place a teabag into a cup.

Pour boiling water into the cup.

Wait 3 minutes.

Remove teabag and enjoy.

This process has a clear start, defined steps, and a desired outcome â€“ the perfect tea.

ðŸ”¹ Programming Analogy
In JavaScript:

javascript
function makeTea() {
  console.log("Boil water");
  console.log("Put tea bag in cup");
  console.log("Pour hot water");
  console.log("Wait 3 minutes");
  console.log("Enjoy your tea");
}

makeTea();
This function is an algorithm â€“ it automates the task of making tea using step-by-step instructions.

âœ… Key Characteristics of an Algorithm
Input â€“ Data needed to perform the task.

Output â€“ Result after processing.

Definiteness â€“ Every step is clear.

Finiteness â€“ It ends after a certain number of steps.

Effectiveness â€“ Steps must be doable.
