1. Introduction to Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of:

Time Complexity → How runtime grows with input size.

Space Complexity → How memory usage grows with input size.

Why is this important?

Helps choose the best algorithm for a problem.

Predicts performance at scale (e.g., handling 1M users vs. 100).

Critical for optimizing real-world systems (e.g., databases, AI models).
