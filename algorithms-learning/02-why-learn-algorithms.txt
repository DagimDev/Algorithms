Why Learn Algorithms?
1. To Solve Real Problems:
Algorithms power everything â€“ from your Google search to Uber routes. Knowing how they work helps you 
understand the core of digital systems.

2. To Think Logically:
Algorithms train your brain to think in sequences, conditions, and loops â€” like teaching your mind how to 
debug life.

3. For Job Interviews:
Companies like Google, Meta, and startups test your understanding of algorithms to assess your problem-solving 
ability.

4. To Write Efficient Code:
A good algorithm makes your code fast, memory-efficient, and scalable.

5. To Build Custom Solutions:
Want to make a quiz app? A to-do list? A chatbot? You'll need algorithms to implement sorting, filtering, 
searching, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Real Example
Let's say you're building a contact list app. Without an algorithm, you'd show all contacts in a random order.
But if you want to sort by name, you need a sorting algorithm.
